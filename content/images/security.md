# Security Best Practices

To further ensure the security and efficiency of image optimization services, you can adopt Cloudflare products that safeguard against malicious activities.

Cloudflare security products like [Cloudflare WAF](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/waf/), [Cloudflare Bot Management](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/bot-management/) and [Cloudflare Rate Limiting](https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/rate-limiting/) can enhance the protection of your image optimization requests against abuse. This proactive approach ensures a reliable and efficient experience for all legitimate users.
